# Tree Tutorial

The target of this tutorial is to get familiar with tree data structures and
particulary, **B**inary **S**earch **T**ree (**BST**) and **AVL** / **Balanced**
tree.

For each type and following similar approach as doen in previous linked list
tutorials, write the different data structures needed and all the functions
to perform **C**reate, **R**emove, and **D**elete oprations (**CRD**
operations).

You can choose to consider iterative or recursive approach.

**Note that we have not mentioned UPDATE operation as it is useless in this
context, and would mean deleting an existing value and adding a new value.**
